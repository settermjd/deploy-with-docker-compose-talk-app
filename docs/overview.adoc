Let's have a bit of a chat about something in the overview of this package which we want to talk about, such that we can create a trivial paragraph.

Let's now add some *bolding* and _italicisation_.
Now that we've done that, it's time to add a table, for more complex formatting.

.A basic table
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2

|Column 1, row 1
|Column 2, row 1

|Column 1, row 2
|Column 2, row 2

|Column 1, row 3
|Column 2, row 3

|Column 1, row 4
|Column 2, row 4
